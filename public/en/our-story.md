  - Hello, I'm Sandra!
  - My story began when I worked as a waitress at a hotel chain. At that time, the executive chef had a business focused on events, which he ran in his spare time. One day, he asked me to help him attend one of his private events, and thanks to my passion for sales and customer service, I accepted without hesitation. After that event, many people started contacting me to help with their private gatherings.
  - Over time, I decided to venture on my own in the world of events. I began by offering planning and setup services with the goal of creating unique and personalized experiences for each client. My dedication and effort allowed me to build a loyal customer base, and soon word of mouth began to open new doors. That's how this wonderful business started to grow.
  - Later, I met my husband, Alfredo, who decided to join the project. With his contagious energy and exceptional customer service, we became an unstoppable team. Alfredo took charge of the bar area, bringing his charisma and enthusiasm to every event, while I focused on the details of planning and setup. Together, we offer comprehensive solutions, from full event organization to personalized services like the bar, designing custom packages for each client.
  - "Today, almost 20 years later and with over 1,000 events completed since we started in 2005, we continue working with the same love and dedication that drove us from the beginning. Our motto has always been: 'Specialists in event setup. Expert hands, impeccable service.' We are passionate about taking care of every detail and creating unique moments that stay in the hearts of our clients."
  - Our dream is to continue growing and to solidify our position as the best option for complete event setups in South Florida. Every event we organize is special, and we look forward to continuing to create unforgettable memories for many more years.
